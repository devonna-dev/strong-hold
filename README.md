# Stronghold

My aspiration for this project is to create a web app to be used by LGBTQIA+ individuals to find affirming and welcoming gyms and more, while also helping folks avoid the not so great ones.

This project (so far) will be built with the following tech stack -

  * vite for faster build times
  * ReactJS
  * TypeScript - type safety is nice
  * react-aria-components - these components are unstyled and accessibility is built in!
  * node.js


To build this and run locally pull down the repo and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` in the browser
